Instructions for setting up a VM on Azure:
1) Go to Microsoft Azure and create a new VM
    a) Use same resource group as past projects or create new one
    b) Name the VM
    c) Adjust the size - for this project, I chose 1vpce 1 gb memory
    d) Create new shh key, if you do not already have one, otherwise use the already established shh key
        i) Creating new instructions:
            a) Generate new key
            b) Download file into a memorable location as you will need the file path for connecting to the VM
    e) Accept all remaining default settings
    f) Hit create - the VM is created
    g) Create inbound and outbound security rule, if desired, to connect via any port
        i) Click on the networking tab on the left-hand side,
        ii) Defaults to inbound port rule, you can see this in the center of the screen.
        iii) Click add inbound port rule
        iv) Adjust Destination port ranges field to *
        v) Rename to whatever you want - I chose AnyPortIn for inbound and AnyPortOut for outbound
        vi) Click Save
        vii) Go to Outbound port rules and repeat steps 2 through 6
2) Connecting to the VM through the command line
    a) Use the following prompt: ssh -i<privatekeypath><fileName.pem> azureuser@location (http address of VM)
        i)Example ssh -i C:\\AzureVMKey\\EricsVM_Key.pem azureuser@20.185.18.23
        ii) You can find the location in the connect tab, located on the left-hand side of the VM's page
    b)You should now be connected to the VM
3) Install needed packages into the VM - the VM comes with a version of git but you need to install the following
    a) Update apt in command line: sudo apt-get update
    b) Install Java in command line: sudo apt install default-jdk
    c) Export Java JDK in command line: export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
    d) Ensure JAVA_HOME is set in command line: echo $JAVA_HOME - should print the above JAVA_HOME path
    e) Install Maven in command line: sudo apt install maven
4) Clone repo off of git hub
    a) Go to git hub and find the repo for the project you want to run in the VM
    b) Take note of the URL for this repo
    c) In the command line: git clone https:/githubURL
        i)Example: git clone //https://github.com/ericjobrien/Project1EmployeeManagementSystem
5) Run the program with Maven
    a) You should now have the cloned repo in the VM, check by using the ls command
    b) CD into the parent directory of the git hub repo - for my example, cd Project1EmployeeManagementSystem
    c) You are now in the parent directory, run the program in the command line: mvn spring-boot:run
